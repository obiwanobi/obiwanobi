- 👋 Hi, I’m @obiwanobi
- 👀 I’m interested in Rust
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Rust
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on, well..., I don't think I'm of much use in other projects, as I'm a very beginner in programming. If you want me to mess up your project, go on, just tell me where...
- 📫 How to reach me: thru github maybe? 
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I can do this: *plops finger out of mouth*
